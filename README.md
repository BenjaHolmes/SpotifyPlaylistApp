# Spotify Playlist Saving App

This project was created using React, it allows you to search for an artist, song or album after you've been authorised by logging into spotify. Then you can add these to a playlist, and send the playlist off to your spotify account.

The hardest part of this app was writing the code to satisfy the Spotify API's authorization.
